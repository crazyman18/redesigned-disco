    <h1 class="page">Tips&Tricks</h1>
    <p>MLBB has a tutorial but that is only how the game work ans stuff but you will not become a great player if you stick with the tutorial so. In this game you will team up with other four players to defeat the other team and you will need a teamwork and create a tactic to defeat enemies .Here are some Tips&Tricks to help you.</p>
    <h2>Tip #1</h2><br>
    <h2>Picking A Hero</h2>
    <p>Picking or Choosing a Hero wisely. This is important one because at first you don't know what hero you should pick because there a lot of heores but first you need to find the best hero you Mastered.</p>
    <h2>Tip #2</h2><br>
    <h2>Don't Hesitate</h2>
    <p>Some players hesitate to use their best heroes because they might lose their winrate but if you don't use your best hero there is more high rate that you will lose but also not always your best Hero you need to follow the Meta(present famous heroes) and if your best hero is countered you should not pick your hero anymore you need to chose other hero.</p>
    <h2>Tip #3</h2><br>
    <h2>Practice Other Heroes</h2>
    <p>Like what i said not always your best hero you need to Pick what is suitable for the enemy. That's why you need to know other heroes and there are also roles: Tank, Marksman, Mage, Figther, and Assassin.</p>
    <h2>Tip #4</h2><br>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <p>The picking of roles depends on the strategy if you guys will be aggresive or not but usually the best roles are One tank, One Mage, One Marksman, One Fighter and One Assassin. But other sometimes do a Two tanks still i depends on the strategy.</p>
    <h2>Tip #5</h2><br>
    <h2>Know The Lane</h2>
    <p>There are in the game called Laning. Means that like you should know your laning still depend on the strategy but usually mage goes on the middle because of the blue buff and marksman goes bot because of red buff.</p>
    <h2>Tip #6</h2><br>
    <h2>Rotation</h2>
    <p>There is a rotation which is more important in the game the rotation is how you will rotate you will not only stick on your lane you need to rotate like going mid lane to top lane to red buff to bot back to mid lane that is how to rotate to make farm faster.</p>
    <h2>Tip #7</h2><br>
    <h2>Pushing</h2>
    <p>This is also important because you can't win without doing this because the goal of the game is to destroy enemys base but you can't do it if you're not pushing others do a split push where enemy will not notice.</p>
    <h2>Tip #8</h2><br>
    <h2>Map&Bush</h2>
    <p>Always beware of ambush. you should always look on map and signal you're teammate if someone is not in the map maybe they are planning an ambush and you should always be careful of the bush maybe there are enemy hidden there. You can use bush to ambush the enemy too. And also master the map so you memorise it.</p>
    <h2>Tip #9</h2><br>
    <h2>Farm&Lord</h2>
    <p>Never forget to farm and it will be great if you still enemy farm so they don't have farms and they have a low gold difference and Never forgot Turtle and Lord it will help on gold difference and Lord will help you pushing.</p>
    <h2>Tip #10</h2><br>
    <h2>Never Give up</h2>
    <p>Don't be scared if enemy still your best pick or if the enemy countered you. There's always a comeback. Even in the game, never surrender just because your enemy is high rank than your team or they have better heroes. All you need to do is focus on game, Farm, Push and Trust Teammates.</p>
    <h2>Tip #11</h2><br>
    <h2>Teamwork</h2>
    <p>Praise your teammates don't make your teammate feel bad because he/she do something wrong never nag your teammate you need teamwork to win this game. Prepare for Teamfight and win.</p>
    <h2>Tip #12</h2><br>
    <h2>Have Fun</h2>
    <p>Last but not the least, Having fun is the most most important not be too outcome dependent on wether you win or lose. In winning there's learning on losing there's also learning.Always look to improve your tactics and yourself. And always have fun, why you will play a game if you're not having fun.</p>
